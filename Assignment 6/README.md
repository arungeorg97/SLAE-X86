**Assignment 6**

Polymorphic Linux Shellcodeâ€ƒ



For this Assignment, we have to create polymorphic shellcode of  3 common shellcodes from shell-storm.org.

	Goal is to change the bits around ,add some junk instructions and trim off unnecassary instruction but keep the original functionality intact.


**Methadology**

	Following Shellcodes are considered for polymorphism

		>chmod /etc/shadow with 0666 permisssion
			Refer : http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-556.php

		>add an entry in /etc/hosts
			Refer : http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-893.php

		>sys_exit(0)
			Refer : http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-623.php
